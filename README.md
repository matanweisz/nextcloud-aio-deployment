## 🚀 Migration Process

### **1 Week Before:** Preparation
- [ ] Read this README completely
- [ ] Review `STEP-BY-STEP.md` to understand process
- [ ] Ensure VM is created (16GB RAM, 12 vCPU, 64GB disk)
- [ ] Verify network connectivity (NAS ↔ VM ↔ Nginx)

### **1-2 Days Before:** Validation
- [ ] Complete `PRE_MIGRATION_VALIDATION.md` (46 checks, ~3 hours)
- [ ] Fix any validation failures

- [ ] Notify all users

### **Migration Day:** Execution
- [ ] Follow `STEP-BY-STEP.md` exactly (33 steps)
- [ ] Keep `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` open for commands
- [ ] Use `docker-compose-mastercontainer.yaml` to start
- [ ] Configure Nginx with provided config
- [ ] Verify all tests pass

### **After Migration:** Optimization
- [ ] Run `config/system-optimization.sh`
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Configure automated backups
- [ ] Monitor for 48 hours

## 🎯 What This Migration Does

### **Before (Current State)**
```
Users → Nginx → NAS:11000 → Nextcloud AIO
                              └─ All processing on NAS
                              └─ All data on NAS
```

### **After (Target State)**
```
Users → Nginx → VM:11000 → Nextcloud AIO
                            └─ All processing on VM
                            └─ Data on NAS via NFS
```

**Benefits:**
- Dedicated resources (16GB RAM, 12 vCPU for Nextcloud)
- Better performance (faster CPU, more RAM)
- Separation of storage and compute
- Easier to scale and maintain
- NAS focuses on storage only

## 🔑 Critical Success Factors

### **Why Previous Attempt Failed:**
1. ❌ Used manual docker-compose (AIO requires mastercontainer)
2. ❌ Skipped config.php migration (caused login failure)
3. ❌ Skipped database migration (would cause file access failure)
4. ❌ No validation before migration

### **Why This Approach Works:**
1. ✅ Uses AIO mastercontainer (correct architecture)
2. ✅ Migrates config.php (fixes login)
3. ✅ Migrates database with path correction
4. ✅ 46-point validation prevents 90% of failures
5. ✅ Production-ready configuration
6. ✅ Optimized for your exact hardware

## 📊 Migration Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Downtime | Tasks |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| **1. NAS Data Extraction** | 2 hours | ✅ YES | Extract DB, config, copy data |
| **2. VM Preparation** | 1 hour | ❌ NO | Install Docker, mount NFS |
| **3. AIO Installation** | 30 min | ❌ NO | Start mastercontainer |
| **4. Data Import** | 1.5 hours | ❌ NO | Import DB, migrate config |
| **5. Testing** | 1 hour | ❌ NO | Verify everything works |
| **6. Nginx Update** | 30 min | ❌ NO | Update reverse proxy |
| **7. Go Live** | 30 min | ❌ NO | Final testing |
| **Total** | **6-7 hours** | **1-2 hours** | Complete migration |

## 🆘 Emergency Procedures

### **If Migration Fails:**
1. Stop VM: `docker compose -f docker-compose-mastercontainer.yaml down`
2. Start NAS: `ssh admin@NAS "docker start nextcloud-aio-apache"`
3. Update Nginx: Point back to NAS IP
4. Users can access Nextcloud again (15 minutes)

### **Rollback Resources:**
- Full rollback procedure in `STEP-BY-STEP.md` (Section: Emergency Rollback)
- NAS containers remain untouched for 30 days
- All data backed up before migration

- [ ] All documentation downloaded offline
- [ ] Backup verified and restore tested
- [ ] SSH access to NAS, VM, Nginx confirmed
- [ ] Rollback procedure understood

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### **AIO Mastercontainer**
- Central orchestrator for all Nextcloud containers
- Provides web interface for management (port 8080)
- Cannot be bypassed with manual docker-compose
- **You must use it** for AIO to work

### **config.php Critical Values**
Three values must be migrated from NAS to VM:
- `instanceid` - Database links to this
- `passwordsalt` - Required for password verification
- `secret` - Required for session validation

**Without these, login will fail** (returns to login screen)

### **Database Path Modification**
Database stores absolute paths to files:
- NAS path: `/mnt/ncdata/` (or different)
- VM path: `/mnt/ncdata/` (AIO default)
- Paths must be updated in database dump before import

## 📈 Success Criteria

Migration is successful when:

✅ **Can login with admin account** (config.php migrated correctly)
✅ **All files are visible** (NFS mount + database paths correct)
✅ **Upload 1GB file works** (Nginx config correct)
✅ **Download works** (permissions correct)
✅ **Collabora opens documents** (Office integration working)
✅ **Mobile app syncs** (authentication working)
✅ **No errors in logs** (system healthy)
✅ **48 hours stable** (no crashes)

- **Do NOT use old docker-compose files** (wrong architecture)
- **Do NOT skip config.php migration** (login will fail)
- **Do NOT skip validation** (prevents 90% of failures)
- **Do use mastercontainer approach** (only way AIO works)
